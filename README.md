# Assignment 1 - ReactJS app.

Name: Kacper Woloszyn

## Overview.
 The app was made to inform everyone about Poland and myself. User can search football players
and learn the vast information that I have provided on the web App. The App has a header that links the various different pages, and also pictures that show a brief overview of what the topic was about. Routing was added in the header to make the design look presentable. Use Gulp and Sass. Sass is a css library and gulp is used to compile it to a minimalistic css. This is done to increase the efficiency and decrease the time it takes for the webpage to load. Used a json server to link players to the web app, and when any user typed in a string that would decrease the list of Polish players, this is done to find out what club they play at and what number jearsey they have. The local cache stored the players in an array. All the routes in the header work and the user can navigate the web-app.

## Installation requirements.
. . . .  List of software used to develop the app . . . . . . . 

+ ReactJS v15.3.0
+ Bootstrap 3
+ create-react-app tool
+ superagent
+ eslint
+ gulp
+ babel
+ json server

When pulled repo, user types in npm install, this will install all the things that are included in my package.json
To run the app, firstly user needs to run a command " gulp " that is used to minimalise the CSS and to make sure the sight is running sufficiently by compressing SCSS into minimised CSS. Whilst this is running the user opens up another terminal. In that she/he types in "json-server ./players.json" to get a json server on port:3000 to have the info of players stored. To make sure it worked correctly, user may navigate to "localhost:3000/players". The json file will be outputed there. The person then types in " npm start " to run a server and when prompt to use port 3001, instead of 3000 user types in Y. This is because the Json Server is running on port 3000. User has the running Web App

## Routing.

+ / - displays home page
+ /team - displays team page
+ /history - displayes history page
+ /facts -displays facts page
+ /origin - displays origin page
+ /food - displays food page
+ /players - displays players page where user can look up players.
+ /sights - displays sights around Poland

## Extra features
I added a header, that was not implemented in any labs. Also used Gulp as I read up it improves efficiency and that was part of the specifications of the assignment. This minimilises SCSS files, which is a Sass library CSS file and outputs it to a new file that takes up less space and is way more efficient in loading. Also added a design feature in SASS, that when any link on the header is dragged on a transition occurs that changes thhe colour of the item and underlines it to highlight the part the user will navigate to next.

## Independent learning.
As mentioned before, I searched a quick and efficient way of loading a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) onto a web app, so that the user gets everything quicker. Gulp and Sass were main ones used. Sass was 
a Casscading Style Sheet library, like semantic but as I learned it may be more used in industry, rather than in college projects. Gulp is Needed for SASS,as SCSS files are not readable in current version browsers, meaning we can write in SCSS then process it using Gulp and then write neater code as the CSS compiled with a tree structure and allow code to be cleaner and more efficient. Needs to be compiled and minified for efficiency as previously said no browser supports the SCSS library.

Also learned how to make a header that links to other pages of the web app, which is like having a main page with links to others, but in a way nicer and neater method.
